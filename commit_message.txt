feat: Add user profile page

This commit introduces a new user profile page accessible at `/profile`.

The profile page is available to all logged-in users and provides a role-specific view of their information and activity.

Key features include:
- A profile header with basic user information, role, and eco-points for students.
- A detailed view for students showing their eco-points breakdown, milestone progress, and challenge history.
- Placeholders for teacher and admin specific content.
- A settings section with a logout button.

The implementation includes new components for the profile page, header, role-specific sections, and settings. The main router in App.jsx has been updated to include the new `/profile` route.
